This program demonstrates a binary tree reference-based data structure. It recursively creates nodes
that point to two different nodes. Each path is created until an ending node is reached, at which point
the last unfilled pointer is filled out. This process is completed until the entire story is filled, 
which then prompts for the title of the file and saves the file. To play the game, that has been
written, the program uses a simple while loop that traverses through the story until an ending is
reached. Input validation has been added to methods that ask for user choices in order to ensure
that the program doesn't throw an IndexOutOfBounds exception and crash if the input is left blank.
